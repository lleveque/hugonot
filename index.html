<p>This is a data repository about Strasbourg-based artist Hugonot P. and his ongoing streetart masterpiece.</p>

<h1>
<a name="artwork" class="anchor" href="#artwork"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Artwork</h1>

<p>Hugonot's work is mainly made of inscriptions on advertising columns in the Krutenau area, in Strasbourg. Inscriptions can be short or long, in any color and usually don't make a lot of sense by themselves. They are eventually covered by new ads and posters, and disappear.
It is not known when Hugonot started this performance/artwork, but it has probably been going on for more than a decade as of 2014. The ephemeral nature of his work makes it difficult to track and document.</p>

<a name="contribute-" class="anchor" href="#contribute-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contribute !</h1>

<p>If you are wandering in Strasbourg, in the Krutenau area, you might come across Hugonot's work. Take a look at those concrete columns known as "colonnes Morris", between concert banners and party posters.
If you spot something, please take a picture and send it to me <a href="mailto:trackinghugonot@gmail.com">trackinghugonot@gmail.com</a> (including date and GPS coordinates would be awesome !).
If you know how to use git, you can also submit pull requests to this repository. Any help is welcome !</p>

<h2>
<a name="planet-of-the-apes" class="anchor" href="#planet-of-the-apes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Planet of the Apes</h2>

<p>Hugonot's work is inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_(novel)">La Planète des Singes</a>, a book written by french author Pierre Boulle in 1963. Apart from the book, the character Dr. Zaïus in particular is mentioned regularly as the Simian leader.</p>

<h2>
<a name="durations-dates-and-ages" class="anchor" href="#durations-dates-and-ages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Durations, dates and ages</h2>

<p>The most recurrent item in the inscriptions is probably "43 years/day". This mention hasn't changed over the years.
Another item is "20 years".</p>

<h2>
<a name="hearts" class="anchor" href="#hearts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hearts</h2>

<p>Whenever a heart appears in the writings, it is to be read as the word "vivant" (living) such as in "être ♥", "être vivant". This clue has been given by Hugonot himself.</p>

<h2>
<a name="christianity" class="anchor" href="#christianity"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Christianity</h2>

<p>Some references to Jesus-Christ (mostly for dates) and to God are also to be found.</p>

<h2>
<a name="names" class="anchor" href="#names"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Names</h2>

<p>Apart from his signature ("HUGONOT P.") and the name of Zaïus, the artist also writes "REMETTER CHRISTINE" regularly.</p>

<h2>
<a name="formatting" class="anchor" href="#formatting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Formatting</h2>

<p>Text is mainly uppercase but portions are lowercase. Most of the text is also underlined and sometimes paragraphs are surrounded by a heart.</p>
