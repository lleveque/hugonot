{"name":"Hugonot","tagline":"A data repository about Strasbourg-based artist Hugonot P. and his ephemeral pieces...","body":"hugonot\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis is a data repository about Strasbourg-based artist Hugonot P. and his ongoing streetart masterpiece.\r\n\r\n# Artwork\r\nHugonot's work is mainly made of inscriptions on advertising columns in the Krutenau area, in Strasbourg. Inscriptions can be short or long, in any color and usually don't make a lot of sense by themselves. They are eventually covered by new ads and posters, and disappear.\r\nIt is not known when Hugonot started this performance/artwork, but it has probably been going on for more than a decade as of 2014. The ephemeral nature of his work makes it difficult to track and document.\r\n\r\n![A text by Hugonot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lleveque/hugonot/master/DSC07458mini.png \"Hugonot on a 'colonne Morris'\")\r\n\r\n# Contribute !\r\nIf you are wandering in Strasbourg, in the Krutenau area, you might come across Hugonot's work. Take a look at those concrete columns known as \"colonnes Morris\", between concert banners and party posters.\r\nIf you spot something, please take a picture and send it to me trackinghugonot@gmail.com (including date and GPS coordinates would be awesome !).\r\nIf you know how to use git, you can also submit pull requests to this repository. Any help is welcome !\r\n\r\n# Reading clues\r\n## Planet of the Apes\r\nHugonot's work is inspired by [La Planète des Singes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_(novel)), a book written by french author Pierre Boulle in 1963. Apart from the book, the character Dr. Zaïus in particular is mentioned regularly as the Simian leader.\r\n## Durations, dates and ages\r\nThe most recurrent item in the inscriptions is probably \"43 years/day\". This mention hasn't changed over the years.\r\nAnother item is \"20 years\".\r\n## Hearts\r\nWhenever a heart appears in the writings, it is to be read as the word \"vivant\" (living) such as in \"être ♥\", \"être vivant\". This clue has been given by Hugonot himself.\r\n## Christianity\r\nSome references to Jesus-Christ (mostly for dates) and to God are also to be found.\r\n## Names ###\r\nApart from his signature (\"HUGONOT P.\") and the name of Zaïus, the artist also writes \"REMETTER CHRISTINE\" regularly.\r\n## Formatting ##\r\nText is mainly uppercase but portions are lowercase. Most of the text is also underlined and sometimes paragraphs are surrounded by a heart.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
